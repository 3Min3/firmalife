Welcome to the first build of Firmalife for 1.20! As always, the mod continues to be under construction. For 1.20, I've taken the opportunity to make some careful choices about what Firmalife is or isn't. This is a first build for me to work from, and while it has lots of new features in it not seen before in the TFC community, I recognize that it may not feel as big as 1.18 did. As 1.20 matures, more features and fixes will be coming. I've included a tentative roadmap below, so you can see what to be excited for.

### Changes

- Some features have been moved to TFC. The major one is jarring, which I've been very happy to rework and make part of the main mod. Pumpkin chunks have also made their journey to TFC land.
- The Squirting Moisture Transducer, the (WIP) ice fishing station, and the Iron Composter have made their journey across the rainbow bridge. You will be missed!
- Added 'panel' variants of greenhouse blocks. These ~~abominations~~ new features will give you more options to make your personal perfect greenhouse. Greenhouse panel roofs double as trapdoors. Panel blocks require special reinforced glass to craft.
- Greenhouse detection has been updated. You can no longer make walls out of half slabs, and your floors can be any block, but need to be not-air. Good luck figuring this out, I haven't written a book entry for it yet.
- Added the Compost Tumbler, a mechanical-power-enabled system that allows you to make more compost with several types of inputs previously unavailable.
- The Stovetop Pot and Stovetop Grill now work much more like the base TFC grills and pots, including having 5 slots!
- Added a greenhouse irrigation system requiring mechanical power. You now can and must pipe water to your sprinklers with copper pipes. Hanging planters require sprinklers to shoot water up at them!
- Added greenhouse 'port' blocks, which allow pipes to pass through them.
- A giant pile of internal changes that took a while but aren't easy to explain. Some of these will improve your FPS.

### Roadmap

- I want to add new foods and meals. I need to fix flatbread sandwiches, and add some new textures made by the community.
- Hydroponic planters are currently disabled. They will be reworked very soon to require piping.
- A better smoking system is planned.
- I plan on making a better edible block system, possibly using plates, including proper rendering for cake, etc.
- I'd like to add more aesthetic options for cellars.
- I'd like to update some of our planter types to be more dynamic and visually appealing.
